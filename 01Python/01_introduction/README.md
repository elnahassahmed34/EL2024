# Embedded Linux Diploma

## Why Learn Python for Embedded Linux?

Python is an essential programming language in the context of embedded Linux due to its versatility and ease of use. Here are some key reasons why we focus on Python in this diploma:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: 
- **Rich Libraries**: 
- **Easy Integration**: 
- **Automation**: 
- **Community Support**: 



## Python Interpreter = Compiler in C/C++


## Create Your First "Hello, World!" Program

### Introduction to Your First Python Program

Creating a "Hello, World!" program is a foundational step in learning any programming language, including Python. Hereâ€™s why this simple program is important in the context of embedded Linux:

- **Basic Syntax**: It introduces the basic syntax of Python, helping you understand how to write and run simple scripts.
- **Environment Setup**: Writing and running this program ensures your development environment is correctly set up and functioning.
- **Confidence Building**: Successfully creating and executing your first program builds confidence and sets the stage for more complex projects.
- **Testing Setup**: It helps verify that your Python interpreter and associated tools are properly installed and configured on your embedded Linux system.

### Steps to Create "Hello, World!"


1. **Write the following code in the file:**

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
2.Run the script from the terminal
    ```sh
    python3 hello.py
    ```    

## Python Data Types 

1. Integer (int)
Integers represent whole numbers without any decimal point. They can be positive or negative.

Example:

```python
x = 5
y = -10
```

2. Float (float)
Floats represent real numbers with a decimal point. They can also be positive or negative.

```python
pi = 3.14
temperature = -23.5
```

3. String (str)
Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed within single quotes (') or double quotes (").

```python
name = 'Alice'
message = "Hello, world!"
```

4. Boolean (bool)
Booleans represent truth values, True or False.

```python
is_sunny = True
is_raining = False
```

5. List (list)
Lists are ordered collections of items, which can be of different types. They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
```

6. Tuple (tuple)
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
```

7. Dictionary (dict)
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are mutable and indexed by keys.


```python
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
grades = {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'history': 88}
```

8. Set (set)
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are mutable but do not allow duplicate items.


```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
unique_letters = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
```
